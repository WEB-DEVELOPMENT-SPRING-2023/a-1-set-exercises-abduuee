    <h2 id="Plot">Plot Overview</h2>
    <p>Caught stealing from a Los Angeles construction site, Louis "Lou" Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) attacks a security guard and steals his watch. After negotiating a price for the stolen material at a scrap yard, Bloom asks for a job, but the foreman at the scrap yard tells him that he will not employ a thief.</p>
    <p>Inspired by a freelance film crew he sees working the scene of a car crash, led by cameraman Joe Loder (Bill Paxton), Bloom steals a racing bicycle and trades it for a camcorder and a radio scanner. That night Bloom shoots the aftermath of a carjacking, moving up close and filming the victim's death to compete with Joe Loder's higher quality footage. Lou gets both him and Loder kicked off the crime scene, and they become rivals and competitors. Bloom offers the footage to a local TV station. The morning news director, Nina Romina (Rene Russo), buys the footage and encourages Bloom to continue his work. She stipulates that the station is most interested in footage of violent incidents in affluent neighborhoods since these attract the most viewers. Bloom hires an assistant, Rick Carey (Riz Ahmed), a young man desperate for money, and begins his career as a professional stringer.</p>
    <p>To get better footage, Bloom alters crime scenes, in one case moving the body of a car crash victim to make a better shot. However, Loder beats Bloom to several important stories and has access to more advanced equipment. Bloom's work begins to gain traction, and he purchases better equipment and trades his old 1985 Toyota Tercel for a faster and brand-new Dodge Challenger. Bloom threatens to end his business relationship with Romina unless she has sex with him, knowing her job depends on his footage. The next day he turns down a business offer from Loder, who beats him to an important plane crash story later that night. Romina explodes in anger at Bloom, demanding he gets footage that viewers "can't turn away from" and keep his end of their bargain. Bloom sabotages Loder's van, causing him to crash into a telephone pole and become gravely injured.</p>
    <p>Later that night, Bloom and Carey arrive at the site of a home invasion in an affluent neighborhood before the police. Bloom records footage of the gunmen leaving in their SUV and of the murder victims in the house. The news staff worries that airing the footage is unethical, but Romina is eager to break the story. In exchange, Bloom demands public credit and more money. The police become suspicious of Bloom and ask for his footage of the home invasion. He gives them an edited tape, withholding footage identifying the gunmen, then locates the gunmen himself. With Carey, he stakes them out at a restaurant, planning to tip off the police and film the confrontation. Scared, Carey demands half the money Bloom stands to make, threatening to tell the police about Bloom's illegal activities. Bloom agrees but demands Carey get out of the car to shoot a supporting angle. Fearing a dangerous confrontation between police and the suspects, Carey initially refuses to leave, but he complies when Bloom threatens him with violence.</p>
    <p>The police arrive at the restaurant and exchange gunfire with the gunmen. One is killed and the other escapes in the SUV. The police give chase, with Bloom and Carey tailing and recording. After the gunman's SUV crashes, Bloom urges Carey to film the gunman, claiming he is dead. The wounded gunman shoots Carey and tries to escape but is shot by police. As Carey lies about dying, Bloom films him and tells him that he cannot work with someone he does not trust.</p>
    <p>Romina is awed by the footage and expresses her devotion to Bloom. The news team discovers that the "home invasion" was actually a drug deal gone wrong; Romina omits this information to maximize the story's impact. Police try to confiscate the footage for evidence, but Romina defends her right to withhold it. Interrogated by police detective Fronteiri (Michael Hyatt), Bloom fabricates a story about the men in the SUV following him; Fronteiri suspects he is lying, but she cannot prove it. Bloom invests in two vans and hires a team of interns to expand his business.</p>

    <p>Los Angeles denizen Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) survives by scavenging and petty theft. He stumbles into a new career as a cameraman and -- armed with a camcorder and police scanner -- begins nocturnal forays across the city in search of shocking and grisly crimes. When he catches the eye of a shopworn news director (Rene Russo) who welcomes the chance to raise her station's ratings, Louis goes to increasingly greater lengths to catch the "money shot."</p>

    <h3>Lou Bloom</h3>
    <!--p tag to define a paragraph-->
    <p>Bloom is a grubby small time criminal with no moral fiber at all. Although he is intended to be an anti-hero it is hard to see him in any type of heroic light at all. He loves filming criminal activity; he feels comfortable amongst the criminal element and will stop at nothing to get what he wants. He is also a predator, coercing Nina into sex with promises of more and more salacious footage for her news station. Ultimately, Bloom is responsible for two deaths - Rick's, by virtue of the fact that he let him die instead of getting him help, and Loder's, by sabotaging his vehicle and causing a fatal accident. Bloom is able to find live crime scenes by listening in on the police frequency with a radio scanner he purchased at a pawn shop. Because he thinks like a criminal he is also able to stay one step ahead of the criminals and find them in the act of committing their crimes. He ends up on top, his career on the rise, his business expanding.</p>
    <h3>Nina Romina</h3>
    <p>Nina is a hard-nosed journalist who runs the newsroom and wants to make sure that her channel stays one step ahead of the other networks when it comes to giving viewers what they want. She also knows that viewers want the shocking, the salacious and the downright voyeuristic, because every time she features this her ratings go up. She also knows that crime against affluent people gets far more attention than crime against residents of Los Angeles' more disadvantaged areas. Nina has no line to cross when it comes to getting a story. There is nothing she believes off limits (for example, the live footage of the family involved in the home invasion) and will over-rule her entire team when it comes to running a story she thinks will cause a stir.</p>
    <h3>Rick</h3>
    <p>Rick is Lou's first assistant and thinks in the same way his employer does; he also tries to shake Lou down for a raise, using what he knows about the way in which he gets his stories as leverage. This comes back to bite him when he is shot by a gunman the men are tailing; Lou lets him die rather than getting him medical attention because he cannot work with anyone who has something over on him.</p>
    <h3>Joe Loder</h3>
    <p>Joe is the first person to explain to Lou what a stringer is - he is one of the men Lou watches filming the scene of the crash he drives by on his way home from selling stolen materials to a scrap dealer. Joe is more the traditional journalist at heart, often willing to share a credit if it means that a better story is achieved. This is not something that Lou is willing to do. Joe is killed when Lou tampers with his truck and causes it to go off the road.</p>
    <h3>Frontieri</h3>
    <p>Frontieri is a detective whose path seems to cross frequently with Bloom's. He is suspicious that Bloom is involved in some way in the home invasion that he seems almost to interrupt. He also feels that Bloom is creating more of the crimes he covers than helping to publicize them.</p>

        <li>Jessica James mentions that some will try to confine this blazing hot social commentary to the realm of media news, but that is shortsightedness to a high degree in the dawn of the internet saturation age. Kudos to all involved. I hope there were Academy Awards, particularly to the director, screenwriters, actors, and actresses. Zounds, what a ride!</li>
        <li>Lauren Styles comments that Gyllenhaal is terrifying as night time crime camera man. He takes the film through a slower middle part, but overall the movie always works: as acid social commentary on media and lack of empathy. The atmosphere of the hot LA nights is almost physically perceptible and the solution after a really thrilling final act is bone chilling.</li>
        <li>Miguel Baker states that Jake Gyllenhaal is a force to be reckoned with, he takes crazy to a new level. The story is a lot more interesting, although it could have been shot better. It is a daunting subject matter, that will have you continue to think after it is over.</li>
        <li>Brian Eggert says Beneath Nightcrawler's outward critique of the media's desperate need to see and record human atrocity for mass ratings, there's a more disturbing character study about Gyllenhaal's fascinating and fantastically played psychopath.</li>
        <li>Cory Woodroof comments that Nightcrawler can be a hard film to stomach at times, but its message is sound. Outside of the strong craftsmanship, the film is a scarily magnetic character study of a guy who dreamed the American Dream in the absolute worst way possible.</li>
