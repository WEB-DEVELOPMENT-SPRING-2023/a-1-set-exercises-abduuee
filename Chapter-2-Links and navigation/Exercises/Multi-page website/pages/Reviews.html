            <li>Jessica James mentions that some will try to confine this blazing hot social commentary to the realm of media news, but that is shortsightedness to a high degree in the dawn of the internet saturation age. Kudos to all involved. I hope there were Academy Awards, particularly to the director, screenwriters, actors, and actresses. Zounds, what a ride!</li>
            <li>Lauren Styles comments that Gyllenhaal is terrifying as night time crime camera man. He takes the film through a slower middle part, but overall the movie always works: as acid social commentary on media and lack of empathy. The atmosphere of the hot LA nights is almost physically perceptible and the solution after a really thrilling final act is bone chilling.</li>
            <li>Miguel Baker states that Jake Gyllenhaal is a force to be reckoned with, he takes crazy to a new level. The story is a lot more interesting, although it could have been shot better. It is a daunting subject matter, that will have you continue to think after it is over.</li>
            <li>Brian Eggert says Beneath Nightcrawler's outward critique of the media's desperate need to see and record human atrocity for mass ratings, there's a more disturbing character study about Gyllenhaal's fascinating and fantastically played psychopath.</li>
            <li>Cory Woodroof comments that Nightcrawler can be a hard film to stomach at times, but its message is sound. Outside of the strong craftsmanship, the film is a scarily magnetic character study of a guy who dreamed the American Dream in the absolute worst way possible.</li>
