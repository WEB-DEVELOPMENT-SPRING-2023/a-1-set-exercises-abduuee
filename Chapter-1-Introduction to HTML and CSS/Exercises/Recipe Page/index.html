        <p>A cinnamon roll is a big, fluffy, soft, and absolutely delicious sweet pastry that is filled with a cinnamon-sugar mixture and rolled into a spiral shape. It is then sliced into individual portions and baked until golden brown. Cinnamon rolls are often topped with a sweet glaze and are a popular breakfast pastry. </p>

        <!--li tag for listing the specific items-->
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 2 cups flour, sugar, yeast, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a heat-safe bowl, combine the water and butter. Heat in the microwave for 30 sec - 45 sec. The butter should not melt completely.</li>
        <li>Pour into the dry ingredients with the egg and mix with a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Add in 2 more cups of flour and mix. It should turn pretty thick and sticky at this point.</li>
        <li>Once it reaches that point, set the spoon to the side and use your hands to mix and knead the dough.</li>
        <li>It will be sticky, so add another 1/4 cup of flour and continue to mix and knead by hand. It should turn into a smooth mass that's soft and tacky.</li>
        <li>With a clean finger, press it into the dough. If your finger is sticking, add another 1/4 cup of flour and knead. If it's not, then shape it into a ball and let it rest uncovered for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and pat it into a rough rectangle shape.</li>
        <li>Spread the butter into a thin and even layer, leaving about 1/2 inch border all around the outside of the dough.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with the brown sugar and spread it even with your hand. Then top it with the cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Roll up the dough into a log. Place your hands at each end of the log and give it a gentle squeeze in to compact the log of dough. It may have stretched out a bit during the rolling process so this brings it back together.</li>
        <li>Using a knife, cut off the two ends of the log and then cut the remainder into 12 pieces.</li>
        <li>Place the rolls in a buttered or greased dish. It's OK if all of the rolls are touching.</li>
        <li>Place in a warm spot and cover with a towel to rise for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350F and check on the rolls. They should have doubled in size and now take up the entire dish.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the tops are a light golden brown. While they cool, make the icing.</li>
        <li>Place the cream cheese and butter in a bowl and use a fork to mash the two together. Make sure they're both softened to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Add the powdered sugar and vanilla and mash again with the fork. Once the mixture starts to loosen, switch to a whisk and mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Spread onto the warm rolls and dig in!</li>
